# Functional programming in JavaScript :books:
This folder was created for me to have quick access to all basic knowledge about functional programming in JavaScript. There are no projects, notes only. Looking for real apps where I used JavaScript? Check out my [Vue 2](https://github.com/mikolajborowski/vue2) or [Vue 3](https://github.com/mikolajborowski/vue3) projects.
