// Currying is a transformation of functions that translates a function from callable as f(a, b, c) into callable as f(a)(b)(c).
// Currying doesnâ€™t call a function. It just transforms it.
//https://javascript.info/currying-partials
//For example I have a function that takes 3 arguments. And my situation is that the first argument is always the same, so I can 
//curry the function, then create a new function by setting first function with first argument with a fixed value, and then
//i have completely new function that needs only 2 arguments, because first one is fixed and always be the same
